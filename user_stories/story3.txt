Story 3

When the user launches the web app, they should be prompted to answer a series of questions about their personal style, body type, color preferences, and budget. The app should then use 
this information to suggest outfits that are tailored to the user's personal preferences. The app should provide clear images of each outfit, along with descriptions of each item in the 
outfit. If the user doesn't like a particular outfit, they should be able to provide feedback so that the app can improve its recommendations in the future
