Story 1

As a user, I want to be able to create an account so I can save preferred outfits. I should be able to reset my password and choose to opt for notifications on the web app. 
Creating an account requires a first name, last name, and an email address. Resetting the password would mean entering an email address. Notifications would alert me of current trends
with corresponding outfits to go along with said trends.
